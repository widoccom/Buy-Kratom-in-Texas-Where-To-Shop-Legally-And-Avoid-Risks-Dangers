**Texas maintains kratom's legal status** at the state level, making it one of the more kratom-friendly states in the nation. Unlike several states that have implemented complete bans, Texas has not enacted legislation prohibiting kratom possession, sale, or consumption for adults.

However, the legal landscape includes important nuances:

- **Age restrictions**: Most reputable vendors require customers to be 18 or older
- **Local ordinances**: Some municipalities may have specific regulations
- **Quality standards**: No state-mandated testing requirements exist
- **Labeling requirements**: Limited regulatory oversight on product claims

### Federal Considerations

While Texas permits kratom, the **FDA has not approved kratom** for human consumption. This creates a regulatory gray area where products are typically sold as "not for human consumption" or for research purposes. The DEA has considered scheduling kratom but has not implemented federal restrictions as of this writing.
